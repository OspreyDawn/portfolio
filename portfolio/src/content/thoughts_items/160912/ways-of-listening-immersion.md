There are two main ways of listening. One way is immersing yourself in the world and the experience of your target audience. The other aspect is of the more obvious kind: actually sitting down and interviewing people. These are methods that aren’t exclusive to design. They are universal just as design thinking is. My time at ClickSuite only made this more apparent.

While at ClickSuite, we were part of a project encompassing multiple companies and vested interests: Commercial, Government and the Public. Archives NZ and The National Library were preparing for the creation of a brand new exhibition. Specifically, a new and invigorated space dedicated to the preservation of some of New Zealand’s most important documents: The Women's Suffrage Petition, the (NZ) Declaration of Independence and, the most famous of them all, the Treaty of Waitangi.

Each was being moved from the Archives NZ building to the National Library down the road. The documents will be hosted in a dedicated space for the foreseeable future for easy access by the public. ClickSuite's role was to design and create the digital parts of the exhibit. Other companies were in charge of the overall vision of the project and the design of the exhibition space and the vault the documents would be kept in.

My interest in this project was both vocational and personal. I have always been curious about the history of the Treaty of Waitangi (WHY-TOUNGE-EE). However, all that was really taught in schools was the usual wrote learning fluff. The cultural impact on the settler population and the native population (that I descend from) seemed biased or incomplete. Also, the effects of the treaty are still felt today through the tribunals that continue with the occasional controversy. It has always seemed hard to get impartial knowledge on the events surrounding the treaty.

This was an opportunity. Personally: to be more informed about my country’s history. Consciously: to provide a space where people could learn comfortably about themselves in an impartial way. Generally: To provide a comprehensive perspective from Pakeha (people of european descent, pronounced PAH-KEH-HA) and Maori (the indigenous population of NZ, pronounced MAH-OW-REE) points of view. This was a chance provide a safe space where the effects of the treaty on the cultural formation of the country could be explored. There are the other documents to consider as well, but none of them were as politically volatile as the Treaty is. Until now, it seemed in current New Zealand culture, there had been no conscious effort to smooth over the various voices in the general public.

### Immersion in Context

Everyone has a goal whenever they set out to do *something*. The problem is, not everyone can clearly articulate what that goal is and why they want to achieve it. Before any work could be done to even start considering end solutions, we needed to consolidate our understanding. We needed to challenge our assumptions: Who are the people we are targeting? What are their goals? Are New Zealander’s really averse to civil discussion about the treaty? How do people experience exhibitions? Why do they even go to exhibitions in the first place? What are their expectations?

Answer these questions and you can build a model to infer design solutions and simulate their effectiveness. Listening is the only way to answer these questions. Listening, as I described in the last part in this series, is not just the act of hearing. It’s looking as well and understanding the context something os 'said' in. This means immersing yourself in the environment and the people you are looking to learn about as well as just talking them.

The first step was to go established exhibition spaces and observe what attendants were doing. If the opportunity arose, ask a quick question or two about why someone is doing whatever it is they are doing. Luckily, Wellington is home to a plethora of exhibition spaces, the most famous and largest of them all being Te Papa. Observing these museums also gave us a frame of reference. What did other exhibitions do well? Where could they improve?

Second, we needed to understand what kiwis (native and immigrant) knew about the documents and how they felt about them. This meant observing how the documents were represented in media and public gatherings. Attending these forums gave us a feel for what topics were understood well and those that weren’t. For example, from a quick survey, barely anyone knew about New Zealand's Declaration of Independence, so that was an easy problem to identify.

Third, we had to consider what it was the stakeholders wanted to provide. The New Zealand government was funding the exhibition. The National Library will host the exhibition. Archives NZ will provide the documents for the exhibition. Each had their own objectives and metrics for success. What were their expectations? Were they aligned with what was expected from the general public? Fulfilling all the expectations of clients can be tricky (especially government clients). However, large bodies and corporates are humans too and must be listened to. At a high and low level, the direct meaning of what they say needs to be observed as well. Are their goals political? Is their view in line of the whole they represent? It's a matter of and understanding their separate terms, needs and how they all fit together.

### Becoming the Flaneur

One of the chief concerns of the National Library was making sure the exhibition would provide appropriate experiences and information for tweens and teenagers. At this point, we had experienced what it was like to go through an exhibition as adults, but not as children. School groups are common guests for the National Library, so we found out when they were next having a group through and followed along. Here were some of the things we learned:

* The role of the group guide was incredibly important in holding the attention of the students. Over the course of the tour, there were multiple guides on hand. One was clearly more engaging and welcoming than the other. To contrast, one was very authoritative and more likely to shut down curious students than to give them leeway. Because of this, students were afraid to participate and engagement was low. The other was much more friendly and engaging and the students were far more attentive because of it.

* Large groups were less effective than small ones. Like herding cats, the bigger the group of kids, the harder it is to keep them focused. This was especially true when an item on display at the library was the focus of a talk. There was no room for everyone to see it and students that couldn't see meandered and became distracted.

* It was clear that the personal stories of the artefacts on display caught the most attention. It gave something for the students to relate too.

* Having a place to get comfortable was important. All the students, when given free rein and when on the tour, needed somewhere to get comfortable. Sometimes they couldn't reliably find an appropriate place to rest.

### Demographics vs Behaviours

So these were what seemed like problems specific to students but as we progressed through the research we found that these patterns were not just exclusive to children. One of the dangers of using a purely demographic focus is that you can forget that behavioural patterns usually occur across demographics. Demographics that may not seem similar due to the methods that are employed by different demographics can turn out to occupy the same behavioural space. Indi Young talks about this in her book Mental Models:

> *You have probably been trained to think "teens" and "senior citizens" fall into to two separate groups; however, when it comes to writing movie reviews, for example, they both may do the same thing. The teenage boy might email a movie review to all his friends. The 70-year-old woman might write film reviews for a local newspaper... these two belong to the same group.*

Grouping people this way, as Young calls it, is called grouping by 'task-based audience segments' or behavioural groups. There is more insight on the nature of a problem to be found in the way people behave rather than how they are classified. Demographics only tell us how old a person is and how their upbringing and culture may have influenced their behaviours. It doesn't actually tell us what any given person will do under certain circumstances. Two senior citizens might be assumed to be the usual attendee for an exhibition, but their demographic doesn't tell us why they go there or who they go with. Demographics don't tell us what goes through the mind of users, they just temper expectations.

The National Library exhibition wants to appeal across the broad New Zealand public. This is where demographics in the traditional sense are most useful. We had to make sure we covered all our bases. For New Zealand that means men, women, children, teenagers, young adult, elderly, Pakeha, Maori, migrants, and any combination of all of these aspects that you might find in one person. These demographics became our checklist to help curate who we selected for the next stage in the process: interviews. Specifically, conversational interviews. The most common way we learn about others is through conversation. Its open ended and there’s no other obvious surface intent to it other than learning more about the other person. They are the natural way of interacting with other people. Mastering it is an art form. The more open ended the questions are in a conversational interview, the more data there is to explore. The more comfortable and valued the interviewee feels, the more they are willing to open their mind to you.
