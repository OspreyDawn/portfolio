    "There are two main ways of listening. One way is immersing yourself in the world and the experience of your target audience. The other aspect is of the more obvious kind: actually sitting down and interviewing people. These are methods that aren’t exclusive to design. They are universal just as design thinking is. My time at ClickSuite only made this more apparent.",
    "While at ClickSuite, we were part of a project encompassing multiple companies and vested interests: Commercial, Government and the Public. Archives NZ and The National Library were preparing for the creation of a brand new exhibition. Specifically, a new and invigorated space dedicated to the preservation of some of New Zealand’s most important documents: The Women's Suffrage Petition, the (NZ) Declaration of Independence and, the most famous of them all, the Treaty of Waitangi.",
    "Each was being moved from the Archives NZ building to the National Library down the road. The documents will be hosted in a dedicated space for the foreseeable future for easy access by the public. ClickSuite's role was to design and create the digital parts of the exhibit. Story Inc. were in charge of the overall vision of the project and [ARCHITECTS HERE] headed the design of the exhibition space and the vault the documents would be kept in."
