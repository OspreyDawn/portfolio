*This is Part 2 in the The Logo Design Process series. See the previous part [here.](#/thoughts/160704)*

Failure is often seen as something to be avoided at all costs, a negative reminder of our fallibility. Failures should be embraced. When we fail, it forces us to be introspective of our actions. It is the cost of failure that should be managed. When the cost is too high we become frugal and rigid in our decision making. So we must make the cost of failure low so we may fail often and quickly so that we can learn more in a shorter space of time to succeed even faster.

If you are designing properly, you are constantly failing but in a way that helps you understand more than you did when you started. For my design process, I like to cast my net wide. For logos, I aim to do at least 10 different iterations before showing them to a client.

When I say iteration, I mean making sure each different sketch is as distinct from each other as possible while still meeting the criteria set out from my brief. They need to be as rough and dirty as possible. This keeps the cost of failure low. Also, too much detail into any idea can, beyond taking longer to do, confuse your client. It can make them think you have made decisions without their input or worse, set expectations too early which can lead to rigidity in freedoms as the process goes on. This is especially true if your client isn't as well tuned to the design process.

Here's the first round of failures I came up with for Devi (because let's not beat around the bush, every design is a failure until proven otherwise):

1. **Geometric** - Here I was keeping it as simple as I possibly could while keeping it a little rough. This was primarily inspired by one of the images Devi provided in her look book, where geometric shapes are present but were corroded.

2. **People** - This idea brought the literal idea of people into the imagery of the logo. This probably could have been explored better to signify the uniqueness in people rather than resorting to a standard ubiquitous geometric representation.

3. **Eyes** - This relates back to the Binoculars (# 5) example but a bit more literal; to see through the eyes of others.

4. **Droplets** - Droplets, while cliché, speak literally to the stories about water. What I really wanted to try here is to represent the idea that Devi uses to describe herself in her article on the Guardian: one of many drops in the ocean. Here I was comparing the ideas of the stories she finds to drops in the ocean and that with enough of them, a tide of change can happen.

5. **Binoculars** - The idea here was to identify stories as lenses or ways of seeing things from a different perspective. (Looking back on it, maybe a periscope could have been better as you'll see below in Devi’s critiques).

6. **Globe** - A bit on the nose, but it fit the '1001' shape nicely and could have been a window to other ideas.

7. **Tape** - Devi puts a great emphasis of listening to people's stories and giving them a voice. The concept of evenly wound recording tape was one idea down this train of thought.

8. **Brush** - Here I tried to use an expressive style to the logo to create a distinct word mark that was whimsical. This was to relate back to the spontaneity of examples in the look-books and, more specifically, the graffiti photos within it.

9. **Trail Map / Cardboard** - These weren't so much logos per se as much as they were demonstrations of embellishments that could be added to any of the previous logos to draw the eye into the logo itself or give it a uniform boundary.

10. **Bicycle** - Devi's main mode of transport seemed like a good symbol to connect her, the people she meets and places she goes back to the reader. Plus the shape of the bike lends itself pretty nicely to the '1001 Stories' name.

11. **Chain** - It would have been preferable not to use a theme so similar to the bicycle. I wanted to make it apparent to Devi that at this stage of the process that a theme can be represented in different ways. Highlighting a piece of the chain was more to express the idea of togetherness.

Failure is expected at this stage because there is no way for us to know we have adequately encapsulated Devi's expectations for the logo. How we measure success is determined by how engaged Devi is in thinking more acutely about what she really wants. Look at her responses below to each iteration and see how she is analysing them to find what aspects she likes and doesn't like before committing to a direction (Charlotte was her partner):

1. "Geometric is too plain."

2. Not mentioned, which in itself says a lot.

3. "We don't like the eyes because it makes it too much about Devi (or one person) rather than focusing on the connection / many-storied nature of the project..."

4. "Similarly, droplets shifts the focus to water, whereas the project is also about climate change -- but more broadly stories & communication."

5. "Binoculars seem too voyeuristic. Plus, the focus is on sound, rather than seeing."

6. "The globes are a neat idea but aesthetically don't tickle our fancy."

7. "Charlotte likes the tape but she's concerned about reproducing it on a stamp. Devi likes the idea but would have to see it in more detail. She's worried that it might not look like a tape at first glance. The nod to older recording technologies is a neat idea, though."

8. "Charlotte likes the handmade look of the brush-stroke. Devi doesn't like how it is diagonal, but also likes the handmade look."

9. "We both really like the cardboard because it is so clear and links back to the beginnings of the project. Could the background for that one be cardboard? That would be super cool. Love"

10. "The bicycle is awesome. Charlotte thinks the frame (not wheels) should be in a lighter grey so that 1001 is clearer. Devi would like to see this design with a cardboard background & STORIES written beneath it. That would be super cool."

11. "Chain is cute, but the bicycle is cuter and easier to relate to. Plus the lines in the bicycle are so strong and visually appealing."

"A merge of bicycle, cardboard, and the word "stories" is our favourite."

> *Note: Using this method to explore logos can mean ideas that have unexplored value are cut off prematurely if the initial idea doesn't sell the concept well enough. Something to keep in mind*

Not only was Devi learning, but from her responses I was learning too. By providing a variety of options, she was able to pick and choose aspects from each of the explorations to inform her decision making. It helped us both narrow down exactly what her expectations were and adequately describe them. Seeing how Devi was analysing each of the iterations gave me a better look into how she saw herself and her project. More importantly, this in turn helped me better understand how she wanted the project to be viewed by others. This also comes down to the virtue of the fact that she is a natural writer. Unfortunately, not every client is one.

From here, we had a pretty clear direction to go down. I went back and created a new set of logo designs with our new understanding in mind.

1. This one is essentially what they asked for, the previous bicycle logo with the border around it with the word 'stories' handwritten underneath.

2. Here I took an opportunity to expand on the things they liked about the brush logo Devi and Charlotte liked earlier; to visualise what it would look like now with their preferences in mind.

3. One way to address one's concern is to just outright take their insight verbatim and see what comes out of it. They said they liked the idea of the tape design, but weren't sure it would be distinctive enough; this is my attempt to address those concerns.

4. Taking into account the bicycle logo design, I also thought it would be a good idea to combine aspects of the other logos they liked into the bicycle design to provide further perspective. In this case it was combining it with the whimsical nature of the brush logo.

5. Again, here is an example of taking aspects of other logos they liked and applying them to others to make new ones. In this case, I was combining the brush and tape logos.

Alas, despite the extra iterations, the first option is the one they wanted. That is not to say the other options didn't provide any value. Their job was to simply provide a contrast to what they originally requested while taking into account what it was they themselves liked in other logos. The extra choices have an equal chance of solidifying their resolve on their final logo as well as opening up more potential avenues. The process is as long as it needs to be (budget concerns excluded).

I never took what Devi said verbatim when translating ideas to the page. Nor was I enforcing my will upon her and championing my 'superior' way of thinking over hers as a 'designer.' Many designers have plenty of horror stories that this attitude stems from. Difficulties that arise with clients of that have their own definition of design is just a sign of a lack of understanding between the two parties (however more often than not, clients just don't want to understand and confronting them about it can only sour the relationship). It's just another factor designers have to deal with that ups the difficulty a notch. However, the earlier you set expectations and communicate the iterative, failure-centric nature of design, the easier it will be to work with them.

Whether clients are being ambivalent or imposing, if a designer is truly having trouble with them it usually means the expectations of both parties are in disarray. The job of the designer is not to tell the client what they want, or give them what you think they want. It's to be the method, the tool, that helps them discover themselves what it is they truly need. Failure is one of those tools because it generates introspection which in turn generates interaction. Without constant interaction and regular failures, neither party will discover what that need is.
