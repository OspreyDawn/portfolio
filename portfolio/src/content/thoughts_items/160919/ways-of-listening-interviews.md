Research interviews are more like a conversation rather than a quiz; the answers sought after are not well defined or known. Interviews are like mining. Questions, like prospecting, picks out a spot to start looking. There are signs to follow that roughly determine how successful that spot will be. Sometimes a rich vein will be struck. Other times there will be nothing. However, people aren’t inanimate mines filled with ore waiting to be extracted. Humans are living beings; access to their minds requires privileged access. Conversation is the means of surveying the mind of another empathetically. An interviewee that feels valued is more willing to let you explore what makes them tick. The more comfortable they are, the more likely it is that a rich nugget of insight into their mind will be found.

### Finding the Right People to Talk to

Before starting, we had to make sure that any interviewees we had lined up were worth talking to and that there were enough of them. Quantity is as important as quality; anywhere between 8 to 16 people is best to start out with. In addition, we had to make sure that they would provide rich answers that gave enough depth to draw meaning from. One way to do this was to go through a screening process: a short list of questions, representative of what you will have in a proper interview. Their purpose is to test people to see if they give you lengthy, well thought out answers. Screeners help to cull those that provide short snippet answers that provide very little insight. The downside with this process is that it is very lengthy and expensive. Due to time and funding constraints we decided to go through a second hand vetting process. We asked people involved across the project if they knew anyone that would be a good interviewee. Because our user focus was so broad we could get away with it thought this isn’t the best practice for all projects.

*It's important to avoid interviewing anyone with a personal connection to you. Answers from someone you know can be skewed because they will tend to go out of their way to help you and bias in questioning can set in. You will also tend to ignore the important minute details of the interviewee because you are used to the presence of people you are familiar with. Selecting people from second hand connections is a nice compromise between all out screening and talking to people you know.*

Finally, we needed to make sure it was worth their time to come in and talk to us. For the everyday New Zealander a simple gift card seemed to suffice. Each individual case will be different, however. Consider what will be a fair trade for the time that an interview will take out of somebody's day. For example, I remember being asked at my Kiwi FOO session "how do you persuade a CEO to take time out of their day to come in for an interview?" This is just another problem that can be solved by thinking like a designer. Put yourself into the shoes of the CEO: We can safely assume that a CEO has a very busy schedule with lots of meetings that can potentially lead to a stressful day-to-day routine. Any extra time outside of their schedule, especially if that time isn’t reprieve from said schedule, has to be beneficial to them. A simple gift card won't suffice for someone, we assume, has a disposable income. The value you have to provide to someone like this has to be something more than monetary. So what would benefit a CEO at a large company? Why not include the CEO in on your findings, providing them with something that can provide more value for their company? You get your interview and the CEO gets insight into how they can make their business better. It’s something they will value more than a pure cash sum and it could potentially be a whole new revenue stream for them. Or, at the very least, it could make their day job easier. Either way, it's a win-win. We had our interviewees, but how do we get the right information we need from them?

### Prompting Conversations

Once a list of interviewees is compiled and vetted, interview prompts must be established and framed to inform the questions during the interview. Prompts are used instead of questions because they provide flexibility to keep the conversation open. No interview will be that same as another. The path of an interview can weave in and out of relevancy, equally going down unexpected lines of discourse as well ad irrelevant ones. The art of conducting the interview comes from navigating these pathways on the fly, deciding what is important at a moment’s notice and progressing accordingly.

The most important factors of interviewing is making sure your prompts lead to impartial questions so that assumptions are checked at the door. This is also where understanding what your assumptions are is most important. When listening, you are voluntarily making your views vulnerable. An interviewer must be willing to leave their preconceptions outside the interview so that the true meaning of whatever problem they are trying to solve is revealed. Knowing and understanding assumptions helps in understanding, when interviewing, if bias is showing through as an interview progresses. It also helps to frame your prompts in a manner that suggests you're willing to hear an alternative answer. Knowledge is never gained by asking questions that only exist to put words in people's mouths.

Choosing prompts should be categorised by the nature of the problem. To start, it was finding out what goes on in people's minds when they go to an exhibition. What could we find out to help us immerse ourselves in their experience? Once that was established, we needed to understand their feelings on New Zealand history. What initially came into their minds and did any of the documents to be on display come into the equation? What were their thoughts, feelings, reasonings, habits, desires, fears, frustrations et cetera? We needed to investigate beyond just the exhibition itself. The experience isn't restricted to physical aspect alone, there's the before and after as well. The context everything takes place in influences everything. To understand why a person does the things they do, we must all learn about the context their actions take place in.

### The Art of Conversation

The best prompts to start with promote softball questions; questions that are simple to answer and put the interviewee at ease. It also helps to establish a conversational mood. As they open up, they become more trusting and as they become more trusting and are confident they are being listened to, the more details about themselves they will reveal. More often than not, the casual nature of the discussion will open up unexpected avenues of investigation. This is the perfect time to scribble down notes to identify potential avenues of discussion later in the interview, careful not to interrupt the interviewee’s flow. It's a conversation after all and being the interviewer is not a passive role. As the interviewee speaks you should be listening for cues and interesting tidbits of information that you think will lead to something that you will learn from later. People will often be speaking in their own language that sheds light into how they think. Using their own language as part of the interview establishes trust and understanding between both parties; a quality predetermined questions don’t have the flexibility for.

Mastering the way of the conversation can take time but the only way to get better is to practice. The best advice I can give is just to be genuinely interested in what the interviewee is saying (as you should be), listen attentively and don't be afraid that you'll miss anything. Conducting the flow of conversation while maintaining quality is multitasking at its hardest. Having a partner to record notes and back you up in case you miss anything is highly recommended and invaluable. Understanding everything being said is not the focus of the interview, that comes after. The role of the interview is to explore the mind of the interviewee and guiding to expose the unknown. If the interview goes down a direction that seems to go off track that's fine, just pull back and refocus when the interviewee has finished talking.

Conversations have rough sections with blurry divisions in the topics that are covered and are very rarely linear and prompts help you plan for that. Here are an example of some prompts I used in my interviews for the National Library project:

* Looking for things to do in Wellington City
* Investigate further into what I want to do
* Picking an exhibition over other other things to do
* Things about exhibitions that appeal to me
* Preparation before going out
* Look for answers on a particular topic
* Things I take with me when going out
* Changes between casual interest and personal interest
* Taking people with me to an exhibition

Prompts are starting points or reminders just in case there is a direction you haven't taken the conversation in yet. Notice how each prompt begins with a verb. Thinking in verbs help you put yourself into the mind of the people you will interview. It helps to expose all the different scenarios a person might go through before and after the actual meat of the topic and the intent behind them. This is where your assumptions are at their most helpful. Here they can provide starting points and context but should be nothing more that: a frame of reference.

### Directing the Dialogue

Sometimes one prompt can naturally weave into other topics already covered by other prompts. Each prompt is purposefully open ended to make sure that under the pressure of interviewing there aren’t limits to one type of questioning. Think of the 5 W's and H of journalistic questioning. With these, one prompt becomes 5 different questions:

* What do you look for in things to do in Wellington?
* Where do you look?
* Who do you ask for advice?
* Why do you do that?
* How do you do that?

Each answer has potential to lead down various different paths to explore. Prompts will always be there in the event the conversation goes completely off track. The most important aspect about the 5 W's and H is that they are open ended questions. Asking, ‘Do you look for things to do in Wellington?' will only net you a yes or no answer. This brings the conversation to a halt; open ended questions ensures the conversation flows. Sometimes you can't avoid closed questions, but they can act as mini-soft balls to further questioning. If they answered yes to the previous question you can ask 'why?' If no, then ask 'why not?'

Other times, silence is the best question to ask; silence naturally wants to be filled. Often if you leave enough space between an answer and a question the interviewee will feel the need to fill it in. This can result in extra little details that can embellish what they just said or provide unestablished context. All that matters is that the interviewee remains uninterrupted. The conversation must flow as naturally as possible. Interrupting too many times can jostle their train of thought. It make them feel like they're on a stand, less comfortable. An interviewee that's uncomfortable isn't going to open up on how the really feel about the topics they’re presented with.

Once the interviews are finished, the arduous part follows: transcribing the interviews. Unformatted data, such as it is at this stage, is practically unmanageable but provides an opportunity. Putting all the collected data from the interview into a readable format that makes it easy to comb. However, the process of combing means refining the tasks into their actionable essence.
