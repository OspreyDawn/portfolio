I love games.

Principles of Game design and general design needn’t be thought as separate entities. While doing my undergrad degree I always looked for ways to apply a game perspective to any of the assignments. Whenever a project enabled me to explore a chosen topic, I took every possible opportunity to bend boundaries of the requirements towards games.

During my second and third year, two research assignments gave me free-reign to dictate my research questions. These assignments were really fascinating and I found myself exploring completely new areas. For example, I now have a really healthy interest in economics (not the neo-classical kind mind you), although almost zero understanding at this point.

The following two papers encapsulate my broader personal views on games, their potential beyond entertainment into daily activity, service and application design. I tried to put across the transformative power of games as succinctly as possible. Games and game mechanics, the way they are designed have the ability to make life enjoyable. Everyday activities or tasks don’t have to be boring and indeed research shows when things are made to be fun peoples’ motivation and well-being rise. But what is fun? It’s a floaty term and one I address.

Game mechanics and the associated theories can be implemented into almost anything. Below are the abstracts from the papers along with links to the PDFs. If you do read them I’d really appreciate any comments.

### Playing by Heart: Play as an Ecological Design Perspective

In our current society, we are accelerating the utter destruction of our climate leaving humans unable to live as we comfortably do now. However, it is not a problem easily solved nor is it one that can be completely reversed instantaneously.

Attempts have been made to reverse the wasteful mantra the industrial revolution has institutionalised but they are not effective. Nor are they coordinated enough to motivate the general populace to drastic change. We are too comfortable with our current state of living or feel powerless to do anything about our predicament.

Play can change this. How? It is in our nature. In this half opinion piece, half research paper, I investigate how play is an essential evolutionary practice. The survival of the human race hinged greatly on play. It has enabled us to become who we are today as species. In recent times however, play has been seen as a ‘worthless’ pastime only for children in the eyes of industrialised society.

It is this mentality that stagnates and stalls the progression of our species and is what will be our undoing. Using methods of play and gradually integrating them into our way of life has the ability to steer our society to a level of sustainability. Companies such as Valve, Google and Pixar already use play as an integral part of their philosophy to resounding success.

Global communities are already forming over the web to establish practices already more viable than our current industrialised society. Change as monumental as changing the way we go about our lives must be subtle, gradual and all encompassing. Play provides the mentality that can establish such change.

### Designing New Institutional Dynamics: Applying Game Mechanics for Social Good.

In the widespread connectivity of our society today, innovation is rapid. However, our current societal institutions have failed to parallel the progress of technology. Current societal interactions lack incentive for a fair governance over commonly held resources. The tendencies of rules that favour the individual have the potential to unbalance the structure as a whole. We do not live in isolation from other people and certainly not from our environment.

In this paper I argue that through the use of game mechanics, improved institutions can be achieved. The benefit of progressing society for the better is not only possible, it can make daily life more enjoyable as well.

Current trends in popular social games and examples of what is possible in the space of augmented reality gaming, show what it is that compels people to partake in these games. Examples from Jane McGonigal’s investigations and Volkswagen’s “The Fun Theory” advertising campaign show what is possible in terms of augmented games and games that aim to change people’s behaviour for the better.

With limitless data at our disposal, the prospect of influencing behaviours through game mechanics with the overall goal of societal prosperity can become possible. The research is there: Mihaly Csiksczentmihalyi’s insight into the dynamics of flow. Elinor Ostroms eight design principles for stable common pool resource management. With these theories as my lens, a system where people’s behaviour changes are accustomed to better societal practices can be created.
