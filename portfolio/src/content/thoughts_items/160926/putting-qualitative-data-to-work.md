Our ultimate goal, with the knowledge gained through listening, is to build a model. Models are the tools that let us act on the world from a specified perspective. They are world views; simulations to inform our design decisions. However, a model on its own is no good if team members or clients can’t discern meaning from it. The data must be repackaged into easily arranged nuggets of information. This way, the model can be built quickly and collaboratively, laying a foundation that ensures readability from the beginning of the process. Models are made to simulate any given scenario and the multitude of variable events that can occur. The more seamlessly it can be read, the easier and faster proposed design solutions can be measured and evaluated.

### Combing the Data

After completing the interviews, there should be 30 to 60 minutes of dialogue recorded from each person as well as notes. In order to make this data searchable and easier to parse it needs to be transcribed. Transcribing can be outsourced to a third party, but I prefer to do it myself or, if I'm part of a team, get others to help in the transcribing process.

Additionally, transcribing interviews someone personally didn't carry out means they are listening to conversations with fresh ears, removed of any preconceptions. It makes new information easier to identify.

However, probably the most beneficial aspect of having various members of the team transcribe data is that everyone is informed on the mental spaces of the audience. For us, we had the project manager, the UI designer and tech lead all involved in transcribing the data. The benefit of this approach was immediately visible during solution ideation. Because everyone had insight into the backgrounds of our audience they could combine this knowledge with their skill-set to come up with unique ideas. As team members have a greater understanding of the broader picture, they attain insight into the ‘Why’ of something being made rather that just the ‘How.’

The greatest aspect of this process is that everyone becomes more personally invested into the project. When a person transcribes, the patterns and data points they identify become *their* discoveries. They are the ones making the connection. When they come to share their findings they are either sharing their new findings or are reaffirming what they did find with others. This means they *own* the data. They become more personally invested. Team members that have a more personal investment become more passionate and involved in the project overall. They can see the greater picture and are more likely to go the extra mile to see ideas derived from the data implemented properly. If there are technical problems that arise during the production phase, they have the knowledge to improvise on the fly. Team members can become comfortable in autonomy. Transcribing this way ensures the designer is not the single authority on the audience’s mind.

Listening back over interviews also puts the team back into the mind of the person talking. Directing the conversation is no longer a concern at this point, it's all about understanding the meaning behind what the interviewee says.

### Identifying Tasks

Not everything said in an interview needs to be transcribed. Each individual recorded quote from the combing process needs to be transcribed in a particular way. It needs to be disseminated into a sharable, contextless format for frictionless sharing and understanding. Knowing what to transcribe can be guided by looking out for mentions of tasks. Tasks can be thought of as behaviours that occur across demographics like in the following example:

> *You have probably been trained to think that "teens" and "senior citizens" fall into to two separate groups; however, when it comes to writing movie reviews, for example, they both may do the same thing. The teenage boy might email a movie review to all his friends. The 70-year-old woman might write film reviews for a local newspaper... these two belong to the same group.

When I say task, I don't mean it in the traditional sense of a specific verb that someone says they do. When humans talk, we rely on generalisations and the context of a specific situation to convey meaning. We have to listen deeper to each quote to make sure all of these external aspects beyond what someone said are accounted for in the identified task to be refined. Identifying tasks in this way will help later in creating similar models of task-based audience segments as shown in the example above.

Indi Young in her book [Mental Models]() has a nice guide on identifying whether what somebody says in an interview is an actual task:

- **Task:** a phrase stating an action or step to accomplish something. *I walk the dogs every afternoon*
- **Implied Task:** a not-so-clear phrase implying an action. *Every afternoon the dogs need to go for a walk*
- **Third-party Task:** a phrase that mentions a task someone else does. *My daughter walks the dogs every afternoon*
- **Philosophy:** a phrase stating a belief why tasks are sone a certain way. *Dogs should be walked twice a day*
- **Feeling:** a phrase describing a person's feelings. *Walking the dogs is my way of relaxing*

To contrast, here are some phrases that sound like tasks but don't directly reveal how someone does that task:

- **Preference:** a phrase stating a person's likes or dislikes. *I don't like walking the dogs in the rain*
- **Desire:** a phrase stating what the person wants. *I am hoping to take the dogs to the new dog park when it opens*
- **Expectation:** a belief that something will happen. *I think everyone will clean up after their dogs at the park*

Thinking of tasks in this way is a great tool to use when listening for the higher level details that people don't explicitly say. They are  important in breaking down how and why people think. Observe, in a task like:

> ’I walk the dogs every afternoon'

Notice how it's very generalised. We're not worried about the specifics of the task shown in something like this:

> 'I open the front door, I attach the leash to my dogs collar...' et cetera.

Young goes into more detail, but for that you can just read the book for yourself.

Interviews provide the raw data for a design researcher to mine through. With the first part of the listening process done, next begins what I believe (contrary to convention) is the fun part: combing through the data. When combing, we are trying to find patterns, correlations and nuggets of insight that will provide perspective into how people think about their problems. Why do I think this is the fun part? While the prospect of reading through lines of text and listening to hours of dialogue seems dreary and daunting, the true joy comes from immersing yourself in the language of others. Getting familiar with their language  means, over time, patterns in the data start to become predictable. As you learn more about the people you interview, the more trends are revealed. All of a sudden the wide swaths of data, that on the surface seem unruly and unrelated, start to come together to form groups of behavioural patterns. These are the patterns that can be targeted and solved for. There are many tools and methods to help comb through all this data to make it easier to organise and share. Below I will share some of these ways that these patterns can be revealed.

### Parsing Insights

When all the quotes have been transcribed and identified as tasks in the sense that Young describes, they must be broken down into a more manageable format. Here's an example of a spreadsheet I put together for the interviews we did for the exhibition:

<div class="gallery">
  <iron-image class="galleryItem" style="background-color: white" sizing="contain" preload fade src="/src/content/thoughts_items/160926/gallery/spreadsheet.png"></iron-image>
</div>

Next, quotes need to be distilled down to their core task so that they can be categorised and grouped more easily in the mental model. Take this quote for example from an interviewee that we'll call Dahlia, a Pakeha mother in her late 30's/early 40's:

> *”Coming from the perspective of someone who has a child and someone who does enjoy art... it's really important... that if I go to an exhibit that I can somehow engage [my daughter]"*

What's the core task here? She identifies herself as a parent and as someone who enjoys art; this is the context. Then she states that something is important, therefore what she saying here is a personally held belief or philosophy. This philosophy is core to her outlook when it comes to looking at exhibitions; this is the task. She believes exhibits should in some way engage her daughter and herself at the same time. Exhibitions should be organised and catered in such a way that both her and her daughter will be engaged by the content there. Understanding that both she and her daughter have different preferences and ways of understanding due to their age difference is important. But Dahlia is using specific terms here that relate back to her using her own language. Her philosophy here is that exhibitions should consider the different ways people engage with them. By that extension, she identifies that different people see the world in different ways. One experience is felt differently compared to other individuals because we ourselves are each distinct. Our senses and ways of looking at the world will always be different. To finally breakdown the quote into a task we would write:

> *Believes exhibitions should have multiple ways for different people to engage with the content on display.*

Let's try another one from a young adult in her late 20's who is a postgraduate history student, we'll call her Tracey:

> *”Interactive things are always very good because... it can become quite tiresome just reading and shuffling along and reading more [and so on].”*

The key word here is 'tiresome.’ This indicates this is a feeling Tracey has with exhibitions, but it is not the core feeling of the task. She says interactive things are good because it is not just reading a wall of text over and over again. This indicates that her primary expectation for an exhibition is to read a lot of things. For Tracey, reading lots of text over and over again can be 'tiresome' so she seeks out different ways of disseminating information to break up the monotony. One of these things could be interactive however, she just wants to mix up the different ways she's engaging with content so she doesn't become fatigued. What she chooses to interact with is irrelevant, so long as it is not the same method over and over again. From this, we can write out the task like so:

> *Engage with different types of content in an exhibit so that I don't get bored.*

These two examples are born out from two completely different backgrounds and philosophies yet there is a similarity between the two. Both are saying there needs to be many different ways for exhibitions to  engage people but each person has completely different reasons for why. One wants to make sure their daughter has something to engage with while they peruse the exhibit for their own pleasure. The other wants to make sure they aren't fatigued by endless walls of text. Fundamentally these tasks fall under the same umbrella of the importance of having varying ways of engaging with content. It is important not to forget that there a many different reasons why this is the case which leads us into the creation of the mental model.
