A logo is more than just an aesthetically pleasing glyph to represent a corporate entity. A logo is the centrepiece of your brand or experience. It's the calling card that pops up in people's mind whenever they think about a particular thing company or body. It's something you can communicate from a distance or up close. It gives those unfamiliar with a brand insight into what the relationship might be like. It sets expectations and moods that targets particular emotions you want to share with an audience so they can feel what you want them to feel. A logo is not separate from the brand it represents, it encompasses the brand; an easily communicable microcosm that is both digitally and physically flexible.

So when Devi Lockwood came to me with a request for a logo for her climate change archival project, it was imperative to understand her motivations, the emotions involved, her goals, the life of her project; where was this thing going to be used? Who will see it?

Devi, you see, is on a mission to collect 1,001 stories from around the world. Stories, big and small, of climate change and its effects on those who tell them; voices lost in a sea of apathy. And so Devi travels on her bike, hopping between countries over freight ships rather than planes, to give people willing to share their stories about climate change a voice. To listen and create an archive that can be shared and accessed by all. To frame climate change and its effects from a personal perspective and make it more than some abstract metaphysical monster. To centralise and create an archive so that other people, be they researchers or other climate change survivors, can access and understand the current state of the world.

At the culmination of all 1,001 stories Devi aims to collect, she will pool them together into an online archive where each story is represented and accessible by a clickable point on a world map. Until then, she needs something portable and easy to draw. From this, what do we now know about Devi? What is she going to be using this logo for before she even begins on putting together her archive. First, she's on the move and is not always going to be carrying around material to share with the people she meets on her journey that points to her journal and website she needs to be able to quickly share with others where their stories and others will be. She's travelling light and she's environmentally conscious; carrying around a bunch of business cards seems counterintuitive to her whole endeavour. She wants to use a stamp instead.

Now we are starting to put together a picture that gives an idea of how Devi works and what her project is about. Our brief is coming into focus. The brief is the set of constraints we set ourselves so we can focus effort where it's needed and better solve the problem at hand. Take using Devi's desire to use a stamp for example: It needs to be clean and simple; too many complicated vertices in the design means it will be hard to define the shape. Not every stamp is the same and ink can be unruly. It also has to look good in one colour; stamps can only use one colour at a time when printing but the colour itself can be interchangeable. The stamp also has the potential to add a pleasant, rustic, personal aesthetic that nicely parallels to Devi's theme of humanism i.e. humans are unique and rough around the edges. Finally, it has to look good on the screen too since ultimately that's where the logo will finally end up, meaning it has to be sharp, clear and flexible at all sizes.

And so just like she does along her journey, I listened to her story gauging the appropriate motivations, emotions and feelings she was so invested in so that I could capture and recreate those feelings in a logo for her.

I also encouraged Devi to compile a list of words or emotions she wanted to associate with her brand along with some imagery to go along with it.

Her words were:
* water
* climate-change
* listening
* activism
* storytelling

She also emphasised the importance in simplicity of the design so that the focus was on the stories themselves. Along with the words, she provided a look-book and described her aesthetic as a "handwritten acoustic landscape with bicycle wheel, sometimes blue." Devi is a poet, so abstraction abound but every little bit counts. The process of any design is about putting yourself in the mind of the user and understanding their mental disposition. What are their problems, what are their immediate emotional needs and understand them?

One does not learn a person in one interaction, it happens over many. Only by exploring a variety of solutions can you possibly hope to find you and your client on the same page.

In the next part in this series, I go in depth into kind of interactions that best facilitate this kind of learning.
