Tauranga City Council, the council of my home-town, are currently exploring the need to publicly archive and share all of the artifacts they have in storage.

I was brought on to look into developing the aesthetics and branding of the site.

This is where I learned about Polymer and developed my front-end web development skills.

The project is still under active development.
