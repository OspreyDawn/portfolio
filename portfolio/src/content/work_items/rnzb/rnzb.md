The Royal New Zealand Ballet and ClickSuite have an on-going relationship lasting several years with a bed of user data to pull from.  During the time I spent with ClickSuite, they were in the midst of their annual website project they go through with the RNZB. This time, the site was to go through a more sizeable update than usual.

I was in charge of taking the research they already had on their users and appropriating it into new, revamped layouts for many of the core pages on the site.
