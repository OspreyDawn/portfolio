The Royal New Zealand Ballet (RNZB) is the national ballet company that promotes performances, solicits involvement and builds community in ballet. RNZB is the centre piece for promoting ballet as a cultural institution within New Zealand. Their web presence is a pivotal tool for presenting the ballet company and the design is often refreshed on a regular basis. When it comes to designing and operating their web presence, RNZB have had a long-term relationship with [ClickSuite](http://www.clicksuite.co.nz/work/rnzb/). This relationship has helped to build a wealth of user-research and audience-familiarity. An asset that was fed into the design process.

For the most recent refresh, the changes where more significant. We were aiming for a site with strong typographic design, updated visuals that enabled rendering flexibility and new layouts. Giving the site a flexible presentation across devices that would work with future content demands.  Rather that starting the design from scratch, the new layouts I developed for the refresh drew from the existing research and sites metrics. Something that made the design work easier. Having that body of user-research gave me the confidence and ability to focus on designing the flexible nature of content presentation demanded in the refresh.

The result is a clean and responsive design with lovely topography, letting RNZB present themselves in a way that reflects their audiences' expectations and the artistic themes of the performances.
