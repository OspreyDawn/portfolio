MediaWorks's [NewsHub](http://www.newshub.co.nz/home.html) unifies news media distribution with consumer access across web, mobile and broadcast channels. MediaWorks is one of three major broadcasters in New Zealand providing television, radio channels along with digital journalism. Prior to [NewsHub](http://www.newshub.co.nz/home.html) these channels where all treated independently and provided a fragmented ad-hoc approach to news distribution.  The project's aim is to combine content for digital and broadcast channels while providing an improved unified experience for consumers.

My team's task was to take the brand values and visual style guide developed by MediaWorks, translate that it into news apps for Web, iOS and Android. I focused on the User Interface design of the iOS app. Working on the interaction, visual and motion design. Exploring and developing the visual styles and animations through many iterations of the supporting design artifacts: task-flows, visuals, interactive prototypes and demonstration videos.

Navigating news content can become unwieldily because you are in some way forcing users to adopt a content classification system that is not always intuitive. The default approach in many News apps to place everything under deep content hierarchies accessed via the infamous hamburger-menu. In approaching the experience design of the App I wanted to eliminate the hamburger altogether. While I was not able to come up with convincing arguments to do so, the reliance on deep content hierarchies was minimised. This was achieved using swiping gestures to navigate a virtual grid of content.  Inline with unifying the user experience across channels, the visual language and gesture based navigation was carried through into the Android App.

> *'The interface is intuitive to use, implicitly informing the user to swipe for more news and to swipe to get out of a news article, too.' - 5 Star App Store review from thedboydguy*

The final iOS App was well received by both the client and their customer-base. In general the reviews of the design have been favourable while the most common negative reviews highlight performance issues and the imposition of advertising; a perennial tension with ad-supported business models.
