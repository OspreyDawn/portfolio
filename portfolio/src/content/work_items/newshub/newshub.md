NewsHub is the name of MediaWorks New Zealand’s effort to offer a unified way of consuming news through web, mobile apps and television broadcasts. As part of the design team at Alphero, Wellington NZ, our task was to digest the style guide made by MediaWorks’ graphic design team and translate it into a modern news app.

I was involved in exploring and developing the visual styles and animations as well as generating material such as prototypes and task flow demonstration videos to be shared with our clients at MediaWorks.
