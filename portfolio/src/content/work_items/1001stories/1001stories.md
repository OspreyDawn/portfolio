1001 Stories is an environmentally conscious movement started by Devi Lockwood to collect individuals' stories from around the world - travelling from country to country on her road bike.  Her particular focus is to capture stories about water. The intention is to build a global oral history archive of these stories.  In doing this Devi seeks to provide a platform for those whose voices go unnoticed.

I worked with Devi to come up with a logo that best captured the humanitarian theme that could be used anywhere she travelled. It was important that the result is easy to spot and emphasised the human side of her collected stories. To dig deeper into the development of the 1001 Stories logo, I've written up the [process](#/thoughts/160704) that I use to [develop](#/thoughts/160711) the visual designs and branding.
