Westpac is one of the largest banks in Australasia. While working at Alphero, Wellington NZ, they were the client I spent most of my time engaged with. When I arrived, Westpac was at the cusp of establishing a new visual aesthetic to embellish their properties with. Our job was to help guide their vision to the digital space appropriately. What works in print doesnâ€™t always translate to the screen.

I was involved in exploring visual styles and layouts to help guide the design of their new website and forms. I was active in attending client meetings to listen and translate their needs into tangible mockups. Most of all, I was responsible for the visual overhaul of the redesign of their web and mobile banking application Westpac One.

There was a clear love for the work they had done before and my task was to help translate their vision and preferences into a workable, usable application for their customers that adhered to their new brand style guide. From wireframe to mockup to animated prototype.
