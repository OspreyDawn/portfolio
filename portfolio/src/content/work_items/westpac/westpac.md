Westpac One is the unified brand for Westpac's digital services across web and mobile channels. Westpac is one of Australasia larger retail and commercial banks. At the time of the project update they were also in the process of establishing a new brand visual aesthetic across all properties. Their existing digital services products had been developed in-house without the help of dedicated user experience design and limited visual design/user-interface design. Our job was to revamp the existing digital properties for the New Zealand market. Working with them to map the updated brand visuals guidelines to the digital space. What works in print doesnâ€™t always translate to the screen.

The work entailed a visual overhaul and user experience redesign of their web and mobile banking application Westpac One. Exploring visual styles, layouts and modes of interaction to help guide the design of their new website, forms and mobile app. Translating their needs and preferences into a lot of tangible mockups. From wireframe to mockup to animated prototype. A big part of the work involved navigating the tension between pre-existing preferences and newer recommended practice. There was strong attachment to the existing mobile apps design and that made it a challenge to explore options needed for merging the new corporate branding style and platform specific human interface design guidelines.

As with all designs, not everything you advocate for finds their way into the final product. However as one reviewer commented

> *'After a very long time the app is actually really good!' - Ben DC on the App Store.*  

I'm particularly pleased with the pin entry sign-in process as it is a pleasant balance of visual and motion cues  that provide subtle feed-back needed to build confidence and reduce pin entry errors. All the icons I designed for the Mobile Apps have been used across other channels of Westpac services since. That suggests that the marriage of the visuals for the mobile app with the brand styles guides resonated beyond the project team.
