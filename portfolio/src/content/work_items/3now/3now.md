3NOW OnDemand is a streaming service for MediaWorks New Zealand, a television, radio and interactive media company. As a part of the app design team of Alphero, Wellington NZ, we were tasked with designing the complete task-flow and visual overhaul of the entire experience.

My role included developing wireframes based on task-flows developed by the Senior UX lead, regularly participating in regular meetings with MediaWorks, translating client requests into features, developing multiple visual directions and creating prototypes to demonstrate task flows and animations.
