Alcohol & Me is a socially conscious digital learning initiative by Lion Co., a beverage and food company in New Zealand. The purpose is to educate individuals about responsible consumption of alcohol. Alcohol & Me is open to all, however the primary aim is for use as a corporate professional development tool.  The principal aim is to educate; What really happens when your body consumes alcohol? Structured as a learning system it provides information chunks through a series of interactive tests and modules. Each module focuses on a specific area on alcohol consumption. Ultimately Alcohol & Me is a strategic marketing product to position Lion Co. as a socially responsible business.

The original Alcohol & Me website is a desktop website. My role was to take the core goals and flows of the site and cleanly translate them into a mobile web solution. This involved redesigning the layouts, content and interactive aspects to suit both the limitations and affordances of a mobile device. Adjusting the interactive to suit touch interactions for example. I also proposed additions that have found there way into the desktop version. At the time of writing the mobile version of Alcohol & Me has not been released.

A key aspect of the project focused on the adaptation of content to suit the limitations of the mobile screen size. The motivation was to make the learning activity more accessible to in-field staff. People that didn't have suitable access to laptops or desktop computers. The content had been developed assuming larger screen sizes and interactions targeted direct interaction with a mouse. The principal challenge, working with the client who had developed the original material, was to streamline the content and interactive tests. Refining the material to suit mobile use while retaining the original intent and information value of the desktop content.
