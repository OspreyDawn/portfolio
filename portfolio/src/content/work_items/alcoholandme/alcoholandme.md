# Alcohol & Me for Mobile Web

Alcohol & Me is a socially conscious digital initiative by Lion Co, a beverage and food company in New Zealand. Its purpose is to provide easily digestible information about what really happens when your body consumes alcohol. It achieves this through a series of small tests and modules that focus on specific areas on alcohol consumption.

When I worked at ClickSuite, Alcohol & Me was only functioning as a desktop website. My role was to take the core goals and flows of the site and cleanly translate it so that it could be easily used and take advantage of the mobile web.

The mobile site is not live at this time.
