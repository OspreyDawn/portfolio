BingeList was a social networking app focused on film and TV show recommendations. The idea, social interactions and reviews of peers to drive the recommendation engine. Started and seed-funded by the co-founders of [Bleacher Report](http://bleacherreport.com/) the company was acquired by Time Warner Media before the commercial release of the product.

As the sole designer I was involved in the product designs from the beginning. Taking the design from extensive user-research into our Minimum Viable Products (MVP).  All visuals, task-flows and interactions derived from the user-research. The design workflow had to fit into a distributed team environment. All results summarised into a set of living documents used to communicate with team members in different time-zones. The process proceeded from research to wireframes, visual explorations, motions designs, clickable prototypes. Each stage punctuated with limited user testing. This resulted in the delivery of detailed visual mockups, reference prototypes and final assets. This also included code for the motion designs. Delivering the animation code ensured easy and accurate implementation by the engineering team, something that was well received. All these artifacts and work-flow helped to coordinate product direction.

It is a rare opportunity to work on a new product design from the beginning and being able to own it. There were many facets of the BlingeList design that I still consider novel. The rating system and the mode of social interactions for reviews worked well. After all the effort it was disappointing not seeing market launch - initial test market feedback was very positive. A big part of the project was developing a good design process. All design ideas and features traced back to the on-going research. The development team embraced the designs as a result. They cam to own both the vision and the realisation. Having other team members to embrace a design as their own should be a goal in any design process. Achieving that is an important outcome so it was gratifying to see this happen.
