BingeList (also known as Rex) was a media recommendations app that used social interactions and reviews from your peers to drive its recommendation engine. It was spearheaded by Sam Parnell & David Finocchio of Bleacher Report in 2014 and they approached me to help with the initial Product Design of the app.

As I was working for them in New Zealand while they were based in San Francisco, I had to establish a cohesive work flow and toolbox to help me communicate effectively the development of my design research and ideas.

Over the course of three months, I conducted user interviews, collated and sorted my findings in a concise, shareable format, created a living document to help coordinate management, development and design directions, developed sharable prototypes and provided detailed visual mockups and properly formatted assets for use with the development team.

BingeList was eventually bought by Time Warner Media as the result of a talent buy.
