              When we humans navigate the world around us, we do so through the
              analysation of all the data that is absorbed by our senses and
              combine it with our inherent knowledge. There are the usual senses
              people can identify which are the most obvious like sight, sound, touch,
              taste and smell but there are an abundance of others that are implicit
              in the everyday, things like thermoception (the ability to detect
              temperature) and proprioception (the ability to sense where your body
              is in space).
            </p>
            <p>
              As soon as we enter the digital world, we lose almost all of our senses;
              we are primarily relying on learned knowledge accumulated through past
              experiences. Vision is our primary sense stimulated through the use
              of visual displays, sometimes sound is present trhough speakers and
              even rarer still is the use of touch through vibration. These seem
              to be the only three senses stimulated in mainstream digital devices.
              Out of the three, vision is the only sense that permeates all digital
              experiences that humans encounter on a daily basis; one sense out of
              many. Not only do interfaces have to have to account for this lack
              of sensorial input but they have to communicate a visual language
              that accounts for this. This puts enormous strain on a user's past
              knowledge to navigate an interface; since the base knowledge of the
              everyday user varies wildly so does the effective mileage of any given
              interface.
            </p>
            <p>
              There's a reason why Apple used skeuomorphism when they first released
              the iPhone. The visual replication of real, tangible objects in an
              interface to communicate how one might interact with them in a digital
              way makes sense; certain physical objects provide affordances that
              contextual-less digital artefacts can't. Prior to the iPhone, there
              had been no uniform visual language to relay how one might interact
              with an interface totally reliant on touch. The Notepad app looked
              like an actual note pad, with yellow paper pages and stitching, buttons
              had visual cues to make them look three dimensional that depressed
              when touched much like one would expect to see in the real world.
              iOS was brand new at the time so they had to communicate how to navigate
              the world that they had created in terms that they knew the everyday
              user would understand.
